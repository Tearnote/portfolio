# Portfolio: a showcase and commission website

*Portfolio* is a dynamic website showcasing my projects, with commissioning functionality, made for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)'s 5th submission project.

## Important notes

The documentation is split across three files:

-   [README.md](README.md) (this file): Overview of the project. Read this to get an idea of the basic concept, technologies used and project conventions.
-   [DESIGN.md](doc/DESIGN.md): UX design notes crafted during early stages of development. The design process is described entirely, from the concept and market research, through information structuring to visual design principles and color palettes.
-   [TESTING.md](doc/TESTING.md): Automated and manual testing procedures are described in detail, as well as their outcomes.
